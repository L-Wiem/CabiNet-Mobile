CabiNet Mobile
========================

Welcome to my project

This is my end of education project - CabiNet Mobile: Android application for patients: to book/update or delete an appointment with their doctor

Note: after setting up both web and mobile applications, you need to change all URLs inside the mobile application code to your web application server: search for **YOUR_PROJECT_HOST** and replace it with your local virtualhost name or your domain name
